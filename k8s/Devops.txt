                                          Devops:--

Agile:
Agile is a software development methodology that focuses on iterative, incremental, small, and 
rapid releases of software, along with customer feedback. It addresses gaps and conflicts between the customer and developers.

devops:
DevOps is a culture that allows the development and the operations team to work together. 
This results in continuous development, testing, integration, deployment, and monitoring of the software throughout the lifecycle.


The major reasons to adopt DevOps are listed below:

1>Faster innovations
2>Shorter development cycles
3>Reduced deployment failures
4>Improved communication and collaboration
5>More stable operating environments
6>Increased efficiencies
7>Reduced Costs and IT Headcount

Technical benefits:
1>Continuous software delivery
2>Less complex problems to manage
3>Early detection and faster correction of defects

Business benefits:
1>Faster delivery of features
2>Stable operating environments
3>Improved communication and collaboration between the teams

Implementing devops to a project:
Stage 1: assessment of the existing process and identify areas of improvement 
Stage 2: Create a proof of concept (PoC).

Devops key performance indicator:
1> Meantime to failure recovery - This is the average time taken to recover from a failure.
2> Deployment frequency - The frequency in which the deployment occurs.
3> Percentage of failed deployments - The number of times the deployment fails.

Git:
1> creating branches /tags for new release 
2> handling user accounts
3> Backups
4> Rollouts
5> hooks
6> Resetting password
7> upgrading 

Release type:
1> major - 3 to 6 months
2> minor - 2 weeks to 3 months
3> Hotfix - 1 day to 2 weeks

version : major.minor.hotfix.buildnumber

in production: release version (1.0.0)
