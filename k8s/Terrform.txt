1) File provisioner 

provisioner "file"{
source =" "
destination = ""
}

connection{
type = "ssh"
host = 
user= ""
password = ""
privte_key = file("")
}

2) Local exec provisioner( to get private ip address of the vm created in azure and store it in txt file)

provisioner "local-exec"{
command = "echo ${self.private_ip}>> private.txt
}

No connection is required 

3)Remote exec provisioner (used along with file prov)


provisioner "remote-exec"{

inline =[
"sudo yum -y install nginx"
"sudo systemctl start nginx"
"sudo cp /tmp/index.html /user/share/nginx/html/index.html"
]
}

connection{
type = "ssh"
host = 
user= ""
password = ""
privte_key = file("")
}


4) workspace (for diffirent environment)

*each workspace can have different set of variables
*Single TF file can manage environments

tf files looks like - terraform.tfstate.d/dev/terraform.tfstate

terraform workspace - h --> help
terraform workspace list - -> to list the workspace 
terraform workspace new name --> to create workspace 
terraform workspace show - -> to see the current  workspace 
terraform workspace select name --> to switch 

inside resource block{
instance_type = lookup(var.instance_type,terraform.workspace)}

variable {
type= map

default={
default = "t3.micro"
dev = " t3.laarge"
prod = "t3.2xlarge"
}
